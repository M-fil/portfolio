        "description": "The goal of the project was to create a web-app for learning English which will be similar to the site Lingualeo. It should have included 6 mini-games, 1 main game, Vocabulary, Statistics, and Settings. To achieve such a goal we put together a team of 6 people (including me). I was a team leader of the project. We use Trello to track project Progress, Git for organizing teammate code and conduct a code review, ChartJS library for graphs on the Statistics page, etc. The project was developed for 1 month and the goal was achieved. The result of it you can see here."
